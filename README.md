## Supported languages

You're currently on the `index` branch.
Since we're implementing PawRD in different languages, we have a branch for each language.

- [JavaScript / TypeScript](https://github.com/LiterateInk/PawRD/tree/js) (base implementation)
- [Dart](https://github.com/LiterateInk/PawRD/tree/dart) (not started)

## Documentation

For now, since we're still in the early stages of development, the documentation is not available yet.

You might go look at the examples for the language you want to use for now.
